# Security Policy

## Overview

The Password Strength Checker Tool is designed with security as a fundamental principle. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting procedures, and commitment to maintaining the highest security standards for our users.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.x.x   | :x:                |

## Security Features

### 🔐 Privacy Protection
- **No Password Storage**: Passwords are never stored, logged, or transmitted to external servers
- **Memory Management**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory after analysis
- **Local Processing**: All password analysis is performed locally on your machine
- **Optional Logging**: Users control what information is logged or exported

### 🌐 Have I Been Pwned Integration
- **k-Anonymity Protocol**: Only the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash are sent to HIBP API
- **Privacy Preserving**: Your actual password never leaves your machine
- **Optional Feature**: Can be disabled with `--no-hibp` flag
- **Secure Communication**: All API calls use HTTPS encryption

### 📊 Export Security
- **Password Exclusion**: By default, passwords are not included in export files
- **User Control**: Explicit `--include-passwords` flag required to export passwords
- **Warning System**: Clear warnings when exporting sensitive data
- **File Permissions**: Export files are created with restricted permissions

### 🔒 Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling prevents information leakage
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security audits of third-party dependencies
- **Cross-Platform Security**: Secure implementations across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Vulnerability Reporting

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email us directly at: **[security@passwordchecker.tool]** (replace with actual email)
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation (if any)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: Our team will investigate and assess the severity within 5 business days
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress will be provided every 7 days
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days
- **Disclosure**: We follow responsible disclosure practices

### Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we greatly appreciate security researchers who help improve our tool's security and will acknowledge their contributions.

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation Security
```bash
# Verify package integrity
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Use virtual environments
python -m venv password_checker_env
source password_checker_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
password_checker_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### Usage Guidelines
- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the tool
- **Secure Environment**: Run the tool in a trusted environment
- **Export Caution**: Be careful when exporting data with `--include-passwords`
- **File Permissions**: Ensure export files have appropriate permissions
- **Network Security**: Use secure networks when checking with HIBP API

### Configuration Security
```bash
# Disable HIBP if privacy is a concern
python enhanced_password_checker.py --no-hibp "your_password"

# Export without passwords (default behavior)
python enhanced_password_checker.py --batch passwords.txt --export-csv results.csv

# Use secure file permissions for exports
chmod 600 exported_results.json  # Linux/macOS
```

## Dependencies Security

### Third-Party Libraries
We regularly audit our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- **zxcvbn**: Password strength estimation library
- **requests**: HTTP library for HIBP API calls
- **colorama**: Cross-platform colored terminal text

### Dependency Management
```bash
# Check for security vulnerabilities
pip audit

# Update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

**Critical (P0)**: 
- Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Authentication bypass
- Data exfiltration possibilities

**High (P1)**:
- Local privilege escalation
- Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of service vulnerabilities

**Medium (P2)**:
- Information disclosure
- Cross-site scripting (if web version exists)
- Input validation issues

**Low (P3)**:
- Security configuration issues
- Documentation security gaps

### Response Timeline
- **P0**: Immediate response, fix within 24 hours
- **P1**: Response within 4 hours, fix within 72 hours
- **P2**: Response within 24 hours, fix within 2 weeks
- **P3**: Response within 72 hours, fix within 1 month

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards
- **OWASP**: Following OWASP secure coding practices
- **NIST**: Aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Privacy**: Compliant with GDPR and CCPA principles

### Data Handling
- **No Personal Data Collection**: We don't collect or store personal information
- **Local Processing**: All analysis performed locally
- **User Control**: Users have full control over their data
